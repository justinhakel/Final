Welcome to my final project for CIS105 - Football Analytics

1. Overview 
- The objective of this project is to analyze mercyhursts Football
season performance using their drives during their game and visualize
how their drives turned out. Also to show distances of drives and see 
from what distances the teams were most sucessful.

2. Webscaping
The data was scrapped from the mercyhurst football webpage
1st scrape:
#
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
url="https://hurstathletics.com/sports/football/schedule"
page = requests.get(url).content
soup = BeautifulSoup(page, 'html.parser')
week_number = 1
for url in urls:
  page = requests.get(url).content
  soup = BeautifulSoup(page, 'html.parser')
  # Extract game-specific details
  game_info_dict = {"Week Number": week_number}
  game_info = soup.find_all('dl', class_ = "text-center inline")
  if game_info:
    headers = game_info[0].find_all('dt')
    data_items = game_info[0].find_all('dd')
    for header, item in zip(headers, data_items):
      game_info_dict[header.text.strip().replace(':', '')] = item.text.strip()
  # Extract scoring summary
  table = soup.find_all('table', class_ = 'sidearm-table scoring-summary highlight-hover collapse-on-medium')
  if table:
    rows = table[0].find_all('tr')
    for i in range(1, len(rows)):
      scoring_play = rows[i].find_all('td')[3].text.strip()
      # Combine game info with each scoring play
      combined_entry = game_info_dict.copy()
      combined_entry["Scoring Play"] = scoring_play
      data.append(combined_entry)

  week_number += 1

  Second Scrape:
  week_number = 1
for url in urls:
  page = requests.get(url).content
  soup = BeautifulSoup(page, 'html.parser')
  table = soup.find_all('table', class_ = 'sidearm-table overall-stats highlight-hover collapse-on-medium')
  if table:
    rows = table[0].find_all('tr')
    for row in rows[2:]: # Start from row index 2 (the third row)
      entry = {"Week Number": week_number}
      tds = row.find_all('td', class_ = 'text-center')
      for td in tds:
        data_label = td.get('data-label', 'No Label')
        text_content = td.text.strip()
        entry[data_label] = text_content
      game_drive_data.append(entry)
  else:
    print(f"No overall stats table found for week {week_number}")
  week_number += 1

  3. Database
  on this page there is a queries.sql file that contains all the queries
  used to create the database and tables along with inserting the data
  scrapped from the webscraping step.

  4. Webapp
  The webapp requiers the user to select a week from the season and then
  a field will appear showing a field and animate the drive distances
  and outcomes for each drive. If the result was a TD it will show the scoring
  information as well.
